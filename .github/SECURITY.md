## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have identified a security issue with Python-dotenv, please email
python-dotenv@saurabh-kumar.com. A maintainer will contact you acknowledging the report
and how to continue.

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting normal
issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address the issue faster.
If you are able, you may also include a fix for the issue generated with `git
format-patch`.
